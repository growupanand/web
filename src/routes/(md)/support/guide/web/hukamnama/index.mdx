# Display Hukamnama

There is a beta hukamnama display available for use in gurdwaras. This display is designed to be used with a Raspberry Pi and a monitor. The display can be used to show any hukamnama (including from Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar, India).

## Features

- The display will show the hukamnama in Gurmukhi, the English translation, and the Punjabi translation/notes.
- If the hukamnama is too long, then the display will automatically scroll after a period of time.
- A progress timer is shown at the top of the screen to show when the hukamnama will scroll.
- A QR code is shown at the bottom of the screen for users to scan and view the hukamnama on their phone.
- The display can be configured with query strings. For example, you can set the date of the hukamnama or remove the QR code.

## Use

Find your shabad using the search bar (e.g. https://www.shabados.com/app/search/hmsp/). Once you have found the shabad, click on the shabad to display it. In the address bar, you will see a URL that ends with an ID. Note down the different IDs that you want to display on the hukamnama. You can then use the following URL to display the hukamnama:

```
https://www.shabados.com/hukamnama/{ids}
```

For example if you want to show the shabad with ID `G05`, then you would use the following URL:

```html
https://www.shabados.com/hukamnama/G05
```

If you wanted to show multiple shabads with IDs `G05` ,`J0N`, `1BS`, then you would use the following URL:

```html
https://www.shabados.com/hukamnama/G05,J0N,1BS
```

https://www.shabados.com/hukamnama/G05,J0N,1BS

Click the example URL to open the hukamnama display in a new tab. You can then use the browser's full screen mode to display the hukamnama on a monitor.

## Advanced

It is possible to customize the display by adding a `?` followed by a query string. Use an `&` to separate query strings. The following options are available:

- `date`: The date of the hukamnama in any string format. For example, `date=2021-01-01`.
- `qr`: The QR code is shown by default. Disable it by using 0 for false. For example, `qr=0`. Otherwise, the QR code is shown.

For example, if you wanted to show the hukamnama for the date `2021-01-01` with the shabad IDs `G05` ,`J0N`, `1BS`, then you would use the following URL:

```html
https://www.shabados.com/hukamnama/G05,J0N,1BS?date=2021-01-01
```

And if you wanted to remove the QR code, then you would use the following URL:

```html
https://www.shabados.com/hukamnama/G05,J0N,1BS?date=2021-01-01&qr=0
```

https://www.shabados.com/hukamnama/G05,J0N,1BS?date=2021-01-01&qr=0

Click the example URL to see the hukamnama display with a custom date and the QR code removed.
